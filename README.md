# MATH372Final
Math 372 final project, hope I get a good grade thanks in advance professor

## Introduction

The purpose of this project was to create a function that produces the following information:

- Data pre-processing (removal of missing observations)

- Model selection that incorporates cross-validation, using various metrics
(adjusted R^2, Mallowsâ€™ C_p, AIC, BIC)

- Where appropriate, shrinkage methods (Lasso and ridge regression)

- Checking for and accounting for outliers, influential points, and points of
high leverage, by providing visual plots and by applying hypothesis tests

- Visual and numerical display of diagnostics for normality, homoscedasticity and linearity

- Determination of appropriate transformations on y and/or inclusion of
higher-order or interaction terms

The way I approached this project was to do all of these steps in Python with the handiness of Object Oriented Programming. In the functionality section, you can find explanations for the code and reasoning behind producing the information during object instantiation.
